## Introduction
The Financial AI Assistant leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to provide intelligent assistance for financial document analysis and queries. The system supports three interaction modes: general conversation, specialized financial queries, and document-based question answering from uploaded PDFs. Built with a Streamlit interface, it offers both interactive chat access and JSON format integration for batch processing, delivering accurate responses through document grounding and citation mechanisms.
